# Film & Cinematography Technical Anaylsis Scripts
(And maybe other things in the future...)

### What is this?
This is a collection of image process and alaysis scripts to process basic image information for cinematogrpahy applicatoins (DLogE curves, etc.)  It may morph into other things in the future, too!

### What Do I need to use these scripts?
Pretty much any new-ish computer should work.  As I mention below, these are tested on a Mac, so your mileage may vary on other systems.  Most scripts I'll put here may rely on 3rd party packages, but they'll almost always be open source (and free!)

I like to use the homebrew package manager to install these on my Mac: [brew.sh](https://homebrew.sh).  apt is a similar choice on Linux.

### Caveats
I've written and tested these scripts completely on my own computer.  As of this note (2/5/21) that's a Mac running macOS 11.1.

Most of these scripts should work on other platforms, but I haven't had a chance to test. Please let me know if you run into issues.

You use these _at your own risk!_  Nothing bad _should_ happen, but if you're not comfortable with the command line interface, it's best to learn slowly on simpler command line applications before jumping in head first.

Have fun!
